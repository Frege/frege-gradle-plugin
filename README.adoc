= Frege Gradle Plugin

This is the official Gradle plugin to compile Frege projects (https://github.com/Frege/frege).  See the example project, https://github.com/mperry/frege-gradle-example, for how to use this plugin.

The latest release is 0.4.1.  Note that the 0.3 experimented with _github releases_ and http://jitpack.io.  There seems to be access issues to the 0.3 release, please use the 0.4-SNAPSHOT snapshot release.

[source, groovy]
----
buildscript {        // make the frege plugin available in our build
    repositories {
        mavenLocal() // if you have the plugin installed locally, this is enough
        maven {
            url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public"
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.frege-lang:frege-gradle-plugin:0.4.1'
    }
}

To locally install this plugin use

NOTE: There is no need to install gradle or anything else beside a recent Java version.
      It is all self-installing.
