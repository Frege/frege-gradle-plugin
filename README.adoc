= Frege Gradle Plugin

This is an experimental Gradle plugin to compile Frege projects (https://github.com/Frege/frege).  It was forked from https://github.com/galderz/gradle-frege-plugin.

See the example project, https://github.com/mperry/gradle-frege-example, for how to use this plugin.

With the 0.3 release we experimented with _github releases_ and http://jitpack.io.

.How to refer to the 0.3 release
[source, groovy]
----
buildscript {        // make the frege plugin available in our build
    repositories {
        mavenLocal() // if you have the plugin installed locally, this is enough
        maven {
            url = "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.frege:frege-gradle-plugin:release-0.3'
    }
}
----


To locally install this plugin use

    gradlew clean install


NOTE: There is no need to install gradle or anything else beside a recent Java version.
      It is all self-installing.
