= Frege Gradle Plugin

This is an experimental Gradle plugin to compile Frege projects (https://github.com/Frege/frege).  It was forked from https://github.com/galderz/gradle-frege-plugin.

See the example project, https://github.com/mperry/gradle-frege-example, for how to use this plugin.  The 0.2-SNAPSHOT build has been uploaded to Sonatype.



To locally install this plugin use

    gradlew clean install


NOTE: There is no need to install gradle or anything else beside a recent Java version.
      It is all self-installing.


CAUTION: For the latest state of development, there is an issue with the dependency to
the frege-repl project that needs local installation since it is not available
in any public repository, yet.
