Generating HTML documentation

Say you have compiled a module foo.bar.Baz and you want to generate the documentation.

java -cp frege.jar frege.tools.Doc -d doc -fp . foo.bar.Baz
This will create a file doc/foo/bar/Baz.html with useful information derived from the class file. Make sure to specify the correct class path with -fp.

Even if you have no documentation comments, the documentation will still include all classes, instances, data types and top level functions, along with their types and may serve as quick overview.

The directory named after -d must exist previously, further subdirectories are created on the fly.

The generated document may contain hyperlinks to documentation of modules your module depends on. They will work under the assumption that all documentation was generated with the same target directory (-d).
